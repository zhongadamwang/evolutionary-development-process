title: "Should I build skill invocation framework?"
---

As I built out more skills to get closer to make a full loop of analysis, modeling and planning process. AI recommends me to build a skill invocation framework. 

I straighted out this way, a new project Establish skill invocation framework is spawned.  The requirements are detailed. All features are proposed are attractive. 

However, I realized it will distract me from building a MVP of EDP.

I am back on track.
