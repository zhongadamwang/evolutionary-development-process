title: "EDPS navigator is born"
---

This is first time I introduce the EDPS name in the skills. It will follow my Evolutionary Development Process methodology. The navigator will lead the skills to collaborate on analysis, modeling and planning.

### Key Features Implemented

- **Natural Language Processing**: Intent recognition and skill mapping
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Multi-skill sequence management with dependencies
- **Copilot Integration**: Seamless conversation flow with skill invocations
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation and alternative path suggestions
- **Context Awareness**: Project stage recognition and adaptive recommendations
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Intelligent complexity management for user experience

This is the second milestone after I created the first skill.
