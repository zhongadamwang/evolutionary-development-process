title: "Did I turn to a wrong direction"
---

In past two days, I am back to work my skillset of evolutionary development process. I felt I need to plan ahead to manage my progesss. This led me to build some project management skills to organize my task. This was a task should be later in my mind. However, it just happened and I created a MVP solution as project management but not small.

This includes following skills
- Project document management
- Project planning-tracking
- project status reporting
- change management


I hope of of these can assist me on the evolutionary journey of building the evolutionary development process.
